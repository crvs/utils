# Utils

A repository for small utilities I find useful (mostly small binaries and such ...)

## List of utilities

- `cerr` -- Pipe `stdin` into `stderr` (mostly useless but fun enough to implement, essentially just substitutes `cat - >&2`.
- `deansi` -- Remove ansi codes (bash colors and such...).
- `escape` -- Escape characters that need to be escaped.
- `watchfile` -- Watch files for changes and run a command when such a change is detected.
